- Enable/disable toggles
- Success rate tracking
- Health score monitoring
- Auto-save functionality

#### `/admin/logs` - System Logs

### 5. Admin API Endpoints ✅
- `GET /api/admin/stats` - System statistics

- `GET /api/admin/connections` - All connections
- `PUT /api/admin/connections` - Update connection
- `GET /api/admin/logs` - Filtered logs
- `GET /api/admin/health` - System health

### 6. Automated Sync Cron Jobs ✅

All configured in `vercel.json`:

1. **Hourly Sync** (`0 * * * *`) - Processes up to 20 connections/hour
2. **4-Hour Sync** (`0 */4 * * *`) - Processes up to 20 connections
3. **12-Hour Sync** (`0 */12 * * *`) - Processes up to 20 connections  
4. **Daily Sync** (`0 2 * * *`) - Processes up to 50 connections at 2 AM
5. **Health Check** (`*/15 * * * *`) - Updates health scores every 15 minutes

Each cron job:
- Queries connections ready for sync
- Triggers banking provider API
- Records sync results
- Updates connection health
- Calculates next sync time
- Handles errors gracefully

### 7. Advanced Features ✅

#### Connection Health Scoring
- Automatic calculation based on success rate, failures, staleness
- Scores from 0-100
- Visual badges (Green/Amber/Red)
- Updates after every sync job
- Manual recalculation function available

#### API Quota Tracking
- Per-provider usage tracking
- API calls, transactions, accounts synced
- Daily aggregation
- Usage percentage calculations

#### Audit Logging
- All admin actions logged
- Queryable via `admin_audit_log` table
- Includes action type, resource, details, timestamp

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
-- 1. Run scripts/migrations/21-add-super-admin-support.sql
-- 2. Run scripts/migrations/22-add-orchestration-tables.sql
```

### 2. Set Super Admin
```sql
UPDATE auth.users 
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"is_super_admin": true}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'your-admin@email.com';
```

### 3. Add Environment Variable
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
CRON_SECRET=<your-random-secret>
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add admin dashboard"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Verify Cron Jobs
- Check Vercel Dashboard → Cron Jobs
- Verify all 5 jobs are registered
- Test with "Run Now" button

## 💡 Key Insights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Vercel Cron over Alternatives**
   - Built-in, no external dependencies
   - Serverless, scales automatically
   - Easy configuration via vercel.json

2. **Database-Driven Scheduling**
   - Each connection stores its own schedule
   - Flexible per-connection configuration
   - Cron jobs query and execute

3. **Health Scoring Algorithm**
   - Balances multiple factors
   - Automatic updates via triggers
   - Visual feedback for quick assessment

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Prevents timeout issues
   - Processes in manageable chunks
   - Handles scale gracefully

### Performance Optimizations

- Connection stats materialized as view
- Indexes on sync-related columns
- Automatic health calculation triggers
- Batch limits to prevent timeouts
- Strategic use of RLS vs direct queries

## 🎉 Conclusion

The admin dashboard is **production-ready** and provides comprehensive system observability, data orchestration, and automated sync scheduling. All planned features have been successfully implemented with proper security, error handling, and user experience considerations.

The system can handle:
- Multiple tenants with full isolation
- Hundreds of connections with scheduled syncs
- Automated health monitoring and alerting
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Scalable cron-based orchestration

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Production Deployment
