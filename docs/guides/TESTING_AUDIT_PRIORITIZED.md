# Stratifi Testing Audit & Prioritized Roadmap

**Date:** November 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit of what needs testing before client onboarding  
**Approach:** Categorized by priority with specific test cases

---

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

**Goal:** 80%+ coverage on critical paths before onboarding paying clients  
**Approach:** Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Write tests first, then implement  
**Strategy:** Focus on categories in priority order

---

## Priority Legend
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Blocking issues for production (security, data integrity)
- 🟠 **HIGH** - Core product value (banking, transactions)
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Important but not blocking (UI, analytics)
- 🟢 **LOW** - Nice to have (edge cases, optimizations)

---

# CATEGORY 1: 🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY & DATA ISOLATION

**Priority:** HIGHEST - MUST PASS before any client onboarding  
**Risk:** Data leaks, security breaches, legal liability  
**Current Coverage:** 10 tests ✅ PASSING (multi-tenant isolation)

## 1.1 Multi-Tenant Isolation (RLS)

### Status: ✅ 10/10 tests passing

    // User in tenant_id=1 queries accounts with tenant_id=1
    // Should return results
  });

  it('should block SELECT for non-member', async () => {
    // User in tenant_id=1 queries accounts with tenant_id=2
    // Should return empty
  });

  it('should allow INSERT with correct tenant_id', async () => {
    // User in tenant_id=1 inserts account with tenant_id=1
    // Should succeed
  });

  it('should block INSERT with wrong tenant_id', async () => {
    // User in tenant_id=1 tries to insert account with tenant_id=2

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Review this audit
2. ✅ Choose timeline (MVP vs Recommended vs Production-Ready)
3. ✅ Start with Category 1 (Security) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
4. ✅ Work through categories in priority order
5. ✅ Track progress with test coverage reports

### Decision Point:
**Can we onboard clients now?**
- ❌ **NO** - Only 5% test coverage, critical security gaps
- ⚠️ **RISKY** - After MVP (2-3 weeks) with known risks
- ✅ **YES** - After Recommended (3-4 weeks) with confidence

**Recommendation:** Complete Categories 1 + 2 (Security + Banking) before onboarding paying clients. This gives you 50% of the way to production-ready, covering the most critical risks.
